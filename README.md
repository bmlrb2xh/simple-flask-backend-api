# A simple flask backend api

My first attempt at making a well structured flask backend api.

## Instructions for quick setup:

1. Create and activate a python venv.

2. Install the dependencies with `pip install requirements.txt`.

3. Create a .env file and paste the contents of .env.sample in it and set the settings.
